Exposing phishing kits, scams and and threat actors.  
Providing exposure and awareness to phishing, spam and scams.  

Hi, thanks for stopping by!ðŸ™‹  

I am a phishing hunter.  

My goal is to proactively monitor for and report fraudulent content of all types as fast as possible to the relevant entities, in order to circumvent the cyber criminal threat actors and stop them in their tracks!  

I focus primarily on:  

ðŸŽ¯ Phishing - this is my top priority!  
ðŸ’¸Financial fraud  
ðŸ’³Identity theft  
ðŸŽ£Cyber crime  
â˜£Malware  
ðŸŽ´BEC Fraud  

My reports reach:  

  *The affected companies / organizations being targeted;  
  *The affected companies, who provide services for the fraudsters to use like VPS hosting,  
  *Domain registration, SSL/TLS certificate issuing and the likes;  
  *The responsible authorities like the IC3 institute, NSA, Interpol, European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) or the CSIRT anti cybercrime division for the particular country or organiation.  

As I do this in my free time, I have created a patreon page and also a buymeacoffee page.
